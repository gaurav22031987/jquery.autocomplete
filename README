Why:
  jquery autocomplete 1.1 official has a bug with IE browsers (6,7,8+) which causes 
  the focus to go to the start of the textbox on mouse-select, rather than at the 
  end for autosuggestions

So:
  This repository contains 1.1 official and 1.1pre, which DOES work in IE.
  
  What i've done is run the jquery.autocomplete.1.1pre thru JSLint to fix any problems
  and then compact it with Google Closure Compiler, hence version 1.1a.pre
  
  For completeness, i've also included the official version, bgiframe (which fixes focus
  in IE, sometimes) and ajaxQueue.
  
Happy coding

Example JS with message at bottom of autocomplete results...

    var data = "Core Core Selectors Attributes Traversing Manipulation CSS Events Effects Ajax Utilities".split(" ");
    $(".autocomplete").autocomplete(data, {minChars: 0});

    function append_message(text) {
      if ($(".ac_results").find("span").length == 0) {
        $(".ac_results").append("<span>"+text+"</span>");
      };
    };

    $(".autocomplete").keyup(function(){
      append_message("If your country is not listed enter it anyway");
    });
